# Tumor-CapsNet
Reproduce results from "Brain Tumor Type Classification via Capsule Networks" (Afshar et al.) for a final project in a Deep Learning class at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
***
## Dataset
[Brain Tumor MR Data](https://figshare.com/articles/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427) posted by Jun Cheng
## Architecture (WIP)
* Original presentation of capsule networks for MNIST done in 2017 by Sabour et al. [3]
* Going to reproduce results done by Afshar et al. [1] and get within at least 0.5% of their results (86.56%).
* May use deconvolutional capsule networks proposed by LaLonde and Bagci [2].
